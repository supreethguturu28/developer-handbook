# HTTP Status Codes Guide

## What are HTTP Status Codes?

HTTP status codes are 3-digit numbers that web servers send back to clients (browsers, apps, APIs) to communicate the result of a request. Think of them as the server's way of saying "here's what happened with your request."

## Status Code Categories

Status codes are organized into 5 main categories based on their first digit:

| Category | Range | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 1xx | 100-199 | Informational responses |
| 2xx | 200-299 | Success |
| 3xx | 300-399 | Redirection |
| 4xx | 400-499 | Client errors |
| 5xx | 500-599 | Server errors |

---

## 1xx - Informational Responses

These are rarely seen by end users but are used for protocol-level communication.

### 100 Continue
- **Meaning**: Server received initial part of request, client should continue
- **When you see it**: Rarely, mostly in large file uploads
- **Example**: Uploading a large video file

### 101 Switching Protocols
- **Meaning**: Server is switching to a different protocol
- **When you see it**: WebSocket connections, HTTP/2 upgrades

---

## 2xx - Success Responses ‚úÖ

These indicate that the request was received, understood, and processed successfully.

### 200 OK
- **Meaning**: Everything worked perfectly
- **When you see it**: Normal webpage loads, successful API calls
- **Example**: Loading Google.com homepage

### 201 Created
- **Meaning**: Request succeeded and a new resource was created
- **When you see it**: Creating a new user account, posting a new blog article
- **Example**: Signing up for a new service

### 202 Accepted
- **Meaning**: Request accepted for processing, but not completed yet
- **When you see it**: Background jobs, async operations
- **Example**: Uploading a video that needs processing

### 204 No Content
- **Meaning**: Success, but no content to return
- **When you see it**: DELETE operations, saving settings
- **Example**: Deleting a file successfully

---

## 3xx - Redirection Responses üîÑ

These indicate that further action is needed to complete the request.

### 301 Moved Permanently
- **Meaning**: Resource has permanently moved to a new URL
- **When you see it**: Website restructuring, domain changes
- **Example**: Old company website redirecting to new domain

### 302 Found (Temporary Redirect)
- **Meaning**: Resource temporarily located at different URL
- **When you see it**: Temporary maintenance pages, A/B testing
- **Example**: Redirecting to mobile version of site

### 304 Not Modified
- **Meaning**: Resource hasn't changed since last request
- **When you see it**: Browser caching, faster page loads
- **Example**: Revisiting a page that hasn't been updated

### 307 Temporary Redirect
- **Meaning**: Like 302, but method must not change
- **When you see it**: Modern alternative to 302
- **Example**: API endpoint temporary redirect

---

## 4xx - Client Error Responses ‚ùå

These indicate that the client (you) made an error in the request.

### 400 Bad Request
- **Meaning**: Server couldn't understand the request
- **When you see it**: Malformed URLs, invalid data
- **Example**: Submitting a form with invalid email format

### 401 Unauthorized
- **Meaning**: Authentication required or failed
- **When you see it**: Need to log in, expired session
- **Example**: Trying to access your bank account without logging in

### 403 Forbidden
- **Meaning**: Server understood request but refuses to authorize it
- **When you see it**: Insufficient permissions, blocked access
- **Example**: Trying to access admin panel as regular user

### 404 Not Found
- **Meaning**: Requested resource doesn't exist
- **When you see it**: Broken links, deleted pages, typos in URL
- **Example**: Clicking on an old bookmark that no longer exists

### 405 Method Not Allowed
- **Meaning**: HTTP method not supported for this resource
- **When you see it**: Using POST where only GET is allowed
- **Example**: Trying to POST to a read-only API endpoint

### 409 Conflict
- **Meaning**: Request conflicts with current server state
- **When you see it**: Trying to create duplicate resources
- **Example**: Registering with an email that already exists

### 422 Unprocessable Entity
- **Meaning**: Request was well-formed but contains semantic errors
- **When you see it**: Validation failures in APIs
- **Example**: Password doesn't meet complexity requirements

### 429 Too Many Requests
- **Meaning**: Rate limit exceeded
- **When you see it**: Making too many API calls too quickly
- **Example**: Refreshing a page too many times

---

## 5xx - Server Error Responses üí•

These indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

### 500 Internal Server Error
- **Meaning**: Generic server error, something went wrong
- **When you see it**: Server bugs, crashes, misconfigurations
- **Example**: Database connection failure

### 501 Not Implemented
- **Meaning**: Server doesn't support the functionality required
- **When you see it**: Unsupported HTTP methods or features
- **Example**: Server doesn't support HTTP/3

### 502 Bad Gateway
- **Meaning**: Server acting as gateway received invalid response
- **When you see it**: Load balancer issues, proxy problems
- **Example**: Web server can't reach database server

### 503 Service Unavailable
- **Meaning**: Server temporarily unable to handle requests
- **When you see it**: Maintenance mode, server overload
- **Example**: Website down for scheduled maintenance

### 504 Gateway Timeout
- **Meaning**: Server acting as gateway didn't receive timely response
- **When you see it**: Slow backend services, network issues
- **Example**: Payment gateway taking too long to respond

| Code | Status | Common Cause |
|------|--------|--------------|

| 301 | Moved Permanently | URL changed forever |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request format |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Need to authenticate |
| 403 | Forbidden | No permission to access |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limited |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Server-side bug |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Proxy/gateway issue |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily down |

## Best Practices for Developers

### When Building APIs:
- Use appropriate status codes for different scenarios
- Be consistent across your API endpoints
- Include helpful error messages in response body
- Use 201 for resource creation, not just 200

### When Handling Errors:
- Implement proper error handling for each status code category
- Show user-friendly messages instead of raw status codes
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Implement retry logic for 5xx errors

### Common Patterns:
```
GET request successful ‚Üí 200
POST creating resource ‚Üí 201
PUT/PATCH updating ‚Üí 200 or 204
DELETE successful ‚Üí 204 or 200
Validation failed ‚Üí 400 or 422
Not authenticated ‚Üí 401
Not authorized ‚Üí 403
Resource not found ‚Üí 404
```

## Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Website:
- Browsing products: **200 OK**
- Adding item to cart: **201 Created** or **200 OK**
- Checking out without login: **401 Unauthorized**
- Trying to buy out-of-stock item: **409 Conflict**
- Payment processing error: **500 Internal Server Error**

### Social Media Platform:
- Loading timeline: **200 OK**
- Creating new post: **201 Created**
- Editing someone else's post: **403 Forbidden**
- Viewing deleted post: **404 Not Found**
- Posting too frequently: **429 Too Many Requests**

## Remember:
- 2xx = Success üòä
- 3xx = Redirect üîÑ
- 4xx = Your fault üòÖ
- 5xx = Server's fault üí•

Status codes are the foundation of HTTP communication - understanding them will make you a better developer and help you debug issues more effectively!
